<h5> <li> This project explains the design of microstrip patch antenna in three shapes: rectangle, triangle, and circle.
    Each shape affects antenna parameters like bandwidth, gain, and resonant frequency.
     The rectangular patch is widely used for its simplicity, while triangular and circular patches offer unique design flexibility.
      Comparative analysis highlights the impact of shape on performance</li><BR>
      <LI>
        The substrate material used is FR4 (dielectric constant=4.6).
      </LI><BR>
      <LI>
        The main aim of this project is to compare these three different antennae based on their gain, S parameter, directivity, radiation pattern, VSWR, efficiency, power radiation.
      </LI><BR>
      <LI>
        The comparative analysis highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each shape, helping to determine their suitability for specific applications. 
        After thorough evaluation, the optimal antenna patch shape is identified, providing the best overall performance. 
        This conclusion serves as a guideline for selecting the most efficient patch design in future implementations.
